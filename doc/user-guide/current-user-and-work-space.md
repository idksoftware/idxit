# Current User and Work space

When you login to windows or any other operating system you will login with your cridentals, i.e, you user name and password. You will be allocated your user space under your name you will have permission to read/write and modify this space. Most users use this space to keep their stuff. As a result this will be one of the important areas to index.

However there may be other users using this same computer they will have their user spaces under their login names. index-it by default will only index the current logged in user namely you.

User Work space

This space is created with you logging for the first time. It is formatted in a consistent way i.e. you will have a Documents folder, a Downloads folder, a Picture folder etc. some of these folder are important to index but others may be excluded such as the Downloads folder. There are also some system files and folders that you probably want idx-it to ignore.
