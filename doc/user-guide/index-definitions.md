# Index Definitions

when you use index-it to create an index you will need to give index-it some information on how that index is to be performed. For example; You may need to give the storage media you wish to use in the index and the folder on which you want the index to start. In addition you will want to filter which files and folders are included and which are not.

Two typical scenario, The first being, you want to include all file and folder types except probably some of the system files that need to be ignored, and maybe some of your own files and folders you wish to exclude.

The second, is where you want to create index of a group of file types because you want to make a collection of file types such as making a music, video or photographic collections. here you will want to create a set of file types that meet a criteria, i.e. on making a video collection you will include all the filet types that are video files such as MP4, MOV, WMV, AVI, etc

However the system may also include file types you wish to include but donâ€™t want the system ones. You will want to ignore those.

## [Filters](../user-guide/filters.md)

Filters allow you to include or exclude File or folder items from your index. These filters, normally filter classes of file. these may be;

system wide files or folders such as the windows folder, system files or folders at the user level or user files

## [Current user and Work space](../user-guide/current-user-and-work-space.md)

By default the current user i.e. you will be included in the index. That means, if the storage selected includes your Work space then it will be included in the index. However if you wish to exclude it you can deselect it in the Index Definition.

## The Index Definition File

This file can be used to define an Index Definition. It con be used instead of entering the Index Definition each time you want to rerun an index. It also can be edited to create an index of a similar type.
