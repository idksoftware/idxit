# Idx-it Application  

This application is a tool to index file items across disks or any storage media that contains files that are readable by you. A file item is a single item such as a document, image, video that is contained in a file. Index-It stores the indexed information in a index information file which allows the index information to be available even if the storage media is off-line. 

A typical use of this tool is where you may have say, family photographs stored across a number of disks that may or may not be on-line i.e. external disks (USB disks for example), but need to be collected together into an index so the photographs can be viewed as a whole rather than just a collection of disks. Index-it can help greatly by managing this collection by identifying and locating duplicate file contents .

Index-It can scan any disk for content type defined by Media type. The the resulting Index Info File is a single file that be viewed and edited if necessary. The content type may be distributed across a number of Media types, for example photographs may be JPG, or any number of raw formats. Index-It can scan for a number of Media types at  the same time.

If the disk is an external disk then Index-It enables you to label that Drive and can be then tagged with that identity so that the scan can be associated with that external disk.
